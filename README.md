# README - Trout Simulation 

# BACKGROUND
* This is a simulation of trout or other river-dwelling fish swimming against current and periodically looking for food. 
  The simulation utilizes equations of classical mechanics to produce motion in a 3D environment. Forward swimming is 
  generated by a spring-mass system where contractions of springs replicate the biological contraction of muscle. Reactive 
  forces, produced when the outer surface of the artificial fish pushes against the surrounding water, propel the fish 
  forward. Much of this, particularly the structure of the fish model, was drawn from the work of Demetri 
  Terzopoulos, Xiaoyuan Tu, and Radek Grzeszczuk at the University of Toronto
